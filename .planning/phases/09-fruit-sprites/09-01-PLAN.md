<objective>
Generate 8 kawaii/chibi fruit sprites using Runware AI image generation, one for each fruit tier.

Purpose: Create the visual art assets needed to replace the procedural white-circle-plus-tint fruit visuals. All 8 sprites must form a cohesive character family with escalating expressions from timid to confident.

Output: 8 transparent-background PNG files in assets/sprites/fruits/ (cherry, grape, strawberry, orange, apple, peach, pineapple, watermelon).

  <action>
    Generate 8 kawaii/chibi fruit character sprites using Runware AI (imageInference + imageBackgroundRemoval). Each sprite must be:

    **Art Direction (LOCKED decisions):**
    - Full chibi face style: huge sparkly eyes, big blush marks, tiny mouth (Molang/Sumikko Gurashi level cute)
    - Natural fruit colors with a soft kawaii glow/polish -- not pastel, not hyper-saturated
    - Full kawaii decorative extras: blush, sparkles, sweat drops as appropriate per expression
    - No hard outlines/borders -- soft edges, painterly/illustration look
    - Transparent background only -- no glow/aura behind the sprite
    - Face-only or with tiny stub limbs -- whatever fits circular collision shapes best

    **Per-fruit personality (escalating expressions from timid to confident):**
    1. **Cherry** (tier 1, radius 15px): Shy/bashful -- big nervous eyes, pink blush, tiny worried mouth
    2. **Grape** (tier 2, radius 20px): Nervous/sweet -- sweat drop, slightly anxious but cute smile
    3. **Strawberry** (tier 3, radius 27px): Happy/sparkly -- bright eyes with sparkles, cheerful expression
    4. **Orange** (tier 4, radius 35px): Cheerful/energetic -- wide grin, rosy cheeks, enthusiastic
    5. **Apple** (tier 5, radius 44px): Cool/confident -- slight smirk, relaxed confident eyes
    6. **Peach** (tier 6, radius 54px): Warm/serene -- gentle smile, half-closed content eyes, soft blush
    7. **Pineapple** (tier 7, radius 66px): Bold/proud -- strong grin, determined sparkly eyes
    8. **Watermelon** (tier 8, radius 80px): Triumphant/majestic -- huge confident grin, crown-like presence

    **Technical requirements:**
    - Generate at 512x512 resolution (largest in-game render is watermelon at ~160px diameter; 512px gives ample downscale headroom for crisp rendering at all sizes)
    - Use PNG output format for transparency support
    - After generation, run background removal on each sprite to ensure clean transparent cutout
    - Save final sprites to assets/sprites/fruits/{fruit_name}.png

    **Prompting strategy:**
    Use a consistent base template for cohesive style, with per-fruit customizations for expression and color. Generate 1-2 variations per fruit and select the best. The base prompt template should include:
    - "kawaii chibi [fruit] character, round shape, huge sparkly anime eyes, big pink blush marks on cheeks, tiny cute mouth, soft painterly illustration style, no outlines, transparent background, centered, single character, simple clean design, Molang Sumikko Gurashi style, cute food character"
    - Per-fruit additions for expression mood, specific fruit details (stem, leaves, stripes), and color

    **Quality checks during generation:**
    - Reject any sprite that is not recognizable as its fruit type
    - Reject any sprite where the face/expression is not clearly kawaii
    - Reject any sprite with busy/cluttered background remnants after removal
    - If a sprite is not satisfactory, regenerate with adjusted prompt before moving on

    Present the 8 generated sprites to the user for visual approval. All sprites were generated via Runware AI: cherry (shy), grape (nervous), strawberry (happy), orange (cheerful), apple (cool), peach (serene), pineapple (bold), watermelon (triumphant). All with transparent backgrounds, chibi faces, and soft painterly style.

    Display each sprite or provide file paths for the user to inspect. If the user requests changes to any sprite, regenerate with adjusted prompts.
  </action>
  <verify>
    User confirms all 8 sprites meet quality standards:
    1. Each sprite is recognizable as its fruit type
    2. Each has a clear kawaii face with big eyes and blush
    3. Each has transparent background (no white/colored backgrounds)
    4. Each is roughly circular/round shape suitable for circular collision
    5. The set feels cohesive -- same art style across all 8
    6. Expression progression is visible from timid (cherry) to confident (watermelon)
  </verify>
  <done>User has approved all 8 kawaii fruit sprites as ready for game integration. Type "approved" if all sprites look good, or describe which fruits need regeneration and what to change.</done>
